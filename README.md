# README File Generator

## Description
This project allows a user to quickly generate a new README.md file by entering in information to the prompts from the console.
The user doesn't have to worry about the syntax or formatting. They just have to provide the relevant
information for each prompt. The inquirer npm module was used to ask and prompt the user for input and the fs module was used
to generate and write to a new file.
